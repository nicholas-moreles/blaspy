Thank you for your interest in BLASpy!

BLASpy is a python wrapper library for Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS).

For more information on BLAS, please see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms

BLASpy makes heavy use of Python's built in ctypes to call the C interface of BLAS
functions. BLASpy does not provide any error checking within its wrapper functions,
and its functions, like BLAS, require many explicit parameters about the matrices
and vectors on which it operates.

For these reasons, BLASpy is not meant to be used directly to compute linear algebra
problems. Rather, BLASpy provides the base on top of which a more complete linear
algebra library can be built.
