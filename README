Thank you for your interest in BLASpy!

BLASpy is a portable, high-performance, linear algebra library for Python that leverages
Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) to improve performance on common linear algebra
computations. BLASpy requires no setup and allows users to call BLAS functions directly
without worrying about data types or overly verbose BLAS function calls.

For more information on BLAS, please see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms

BLASpy operates on the NumPy "matrix" and "ndarray" data structures that are already
in widespread use. As a result, it is required that NumPy be installed in order to run
BLASpy. Using the BLASpy library instead of NumPy's standard linear algebra results in
significantly improved performance.
