Thank you for your interest in BLASpy!

BLASpy is a Python wrapper library for Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS).

For more information on BLAS, please see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms

BLASpy makes heavy use of Python's built in ctypes to call the C interface of BLAS
functions. BLASpy does not provide any error checking within its functions,
and like BLAS, its functions require many explicit parameters about the matrices
and vectors on which it operates.

This allows BLASpy to limit its overhead, but it also means that BLASpy is not meant
to be used directly, except by advanced users who are familiar with calling BLAS
functions. Rather, BLASpy provides a foundation on top of which a more complete and
user-friendly linear algebra library can be built.
