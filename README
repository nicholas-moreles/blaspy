Thank you for your interest in BLASpy!

BLASpy is a linear algebra library for Python that leverages Basic Linear Algebra
Subprograms (BLAS) to improve performance on common linear algebra computations.
BLASpy requires minimal setup and allows users to call BLAS functions directly
without worrying about data types or overly verbose BLAS function calls.

For more information on BLAS, please see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms

BLASpy operates on the numpy "matrix" and "ndarray" data structures that are already
in widespread use. Using the BLASpy library in place of numpy's standard linear
algebra library results in significantly improved performance.

*************************************************************************************
* BLASpy is currently in a development phase and is not yet complete. Many          *
* functions are not yet in their final form.                                        *
