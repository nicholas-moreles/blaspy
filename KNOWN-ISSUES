The following is a list of known issues with BLASpy:

- Only single-precision (float32) and double-precision (float64) NumPy matrices
  and ndarrays are currently supported by BLASpy. Work on complex data types
  may or may not ever occur, as the limitation currently lies with ctypes.

- BLASpy does not interface with all CBLAS functions. The omitted functions are
  considered to be unnecessary at this time, but they may be included in the future.
