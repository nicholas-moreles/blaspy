The following is a list of known issues with BLASpy:

- Only single-precision (float32) and double-precision (float64) NumPy matrices
  and ndarrays are currently supported by BLASpy. Work on complex data types
  will be started only after most BLAS routines are supported for real data types.

- There is currently no system in place to make installation of BLASpy user-friendly.
  This will be added before work on complex data types begins.
