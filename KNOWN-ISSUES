The following is a list of known issues with BLASpy:

- The following BLAS subroutines are included, but commented out to prevent
  use, because they do not function properly:

      - dsdot

  It is possible that an attempt will be made to fix their issues upon
  completion of BLASpy, but it is also possible that these subroutines are
  hindered by the ctypes interface, and as such, will never be included in
  BLASpy.
